This project aims to help you keep track of your daily mood and wellness. The app features assessments and wellness checks, utilizing color and shape theory to visually represent your mood. You'll have access to a wide range of emotions to choose from, and you can even add your own if necessary. Additionally, you can record the experiences that made you feel a certain way with just a click of a button or through journaling with unlimited edits. The app sends daily notifications for checkups, with a mid-day check-in and an overall mood of the day. If you're unable to respond at the moment, you can simply snooze the notification. The app also includes an autosave function, so you don't need to worry about losing your progress. After each check-in, you'll receive regular feedback and tips, along with access to mindful meditation and information. You can view your mood trends by the month or week, using interactive graphs and visuals.

## Notes

I faced a minor challenge while trying to maintain the readability of the changing text color and
providing enough contrast against the background. Furthermore, coding in Swift was a significant
learning curve for me since it was my first time working with both Swift and SwiftUI. Despite
these challenges, the experience was rewarding, and I am excited to continue exploring and
expanding the simple application that I developed to further enhance my knowledge.
