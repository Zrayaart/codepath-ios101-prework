This project aims to develop a Food and drink mobile app similar to Cava but with better visual
aesthetics and incorporating the functionality of Uber Eats. The app will provide a seamless user
experience through the use of attractive visuals and an uncluttered interface, with features such
as vertical scroll, a custom tip option, adding items after purchasing, and removing individual
ingredients at checkout. Additionally, the app will offer a search and filter function to help
users with allergies avoid ingredients such as dairy or peanuts, thereby catering to the needs of
its users and setting itself apart from its competitors in the market.

## Notes

I faced a minor challenge while trying to maintain the readability of the changing text color and
providing enough contrast against the background. Furthermore, coding in Swift was a significant
learning curve for me since it was my first time working with both Swift and SwiftUI. Despite
these challenges, the experience was rewarding, and I am excited to continue exploring and
expanding the simple application that I developed to further enhance my knowledge.
